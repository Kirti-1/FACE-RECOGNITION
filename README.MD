>It's easy for humans to recognize faces, but What about a successful recognition of face via a machine?
>Humans while recognizing they consider basic features as eye, nose, mouth, head shape and so on.
>The recognition was performed by calculating the euclidean distance between feature vectors of a probe and reference image. Such a method is robust against changes in illumination by its nature, but has a huge drawback: the accurate registration of the marker points is complicated
